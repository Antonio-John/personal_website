                        One of my favourite films is the Imitation game featuring Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley. 
                        This film tells the story of a mathematician Alan Turing who tries to break the german Enigma Code.
                        The Enigma Code was a method of encrypting messages. This enabled the german army to send messages
                        to each other without fear of messages being intercepted and decoded. I really recommend watching
                        if you haven't had the pleasure.

                        This lead me to be more interested in the field of cryptology and the history surrounding it. 
                        In my Undergraduate degree I chose to study a module in cryptology. The module highlighted the 
                        history surrounding cryptology from ancient greece to the present day. There has always been the 
                        need for secrecy and I find it curious how these mathematically based ciphers were developed. Below
                        is an ancient technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scytale"> Scytale</a>. This focuses
                        on writing a message into a single strip of parchment. The two communicators would use a same size rod and 
                        decrypt the message by wrapping the parchment round their rods.

                        One of my assesments was to decrypt random text using different ciphers. Python and coding in general is a 
                        very powerful tool as it allows us to compute and automate processes which can be very time consuming when done manually.
                        I wanted to create an automated process to do this, so started writing some code which allowed me decrypt/encrypt text. 
                        The four ciphers I focussed on were atbash, ceaser, playfair and vigenere. Not going to go too much into detail about 
                        the specific code but it is all publicaly available here on <a href="https://github.com/pyantonio-coder/crypto/tree/main">github</a>. 
                        It is split into seperate scripts as below:
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class = "info_cv">
                    <p class = "cv_paragraph">
                        Contained within the cryptology.py script are the eight main functions of the ciphers mentioned above (one for encryption and one for decryption). 
                        Full docs for these functions can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/pyantonio-coder/crypto/blob/main/README.md">Readme.MD</a> on the github page.
                        The tools.py script contain mini function which are used within the eight main functions. They break the main functions into smaller, easily 
                        managable chunks of code. This makes it easier to debug code as well as unittest code. Every function created within these two files are tested
                        within the tests folder. I used the unittest framework but other frameworks like Pytest are available.

                       The above code helped me answer my assesment questions but one of the great things about Python is the ability to share and distribute 
                       code to others. This was my first time attempting this, the guidance I used was a

                        Once everything was ready I could upload the package to Pypi. This is a library of over 330,000 python packages!
                        The process I used to do this was the following:

                        Sdist is short for Source Distribution. This commands took all the information from the setup.py files
                        and created the package information/files for me. With this command the package is stored locally, 
                        the last thing I needed to do was to upload the package to PyPi. There are several ways to do this
                        but the method I used was using an existing package called twine. With the following command this uploaded everything 
                        for me. I got onto the PyPi quick enough to see my package on the home page.

                       There are many other cryptological techniques that exist including Hill & Rotor ciphers. These will be created as issues
                       on the github page to be picked up by anyone. I'd also like to automate the testing potentially a tox file. This is an 
                       area I would like to know more on. This would allow the automation of checking that all unit tests are passing instead of manually having to run them.
                       I learnt a great deal whilst publishing the code and if you want to be able to distribute your code for anyone to used
                       this is a great learning opportunity.
