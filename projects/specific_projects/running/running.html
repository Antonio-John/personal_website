                        On the 12th October 2019 I decided to attend a <a href="https://www.parkrun.org.uk">parkrun</a>. If you aren't aware of these,
                        they are a free timed 5K event that happen in parks across the worlds every Saturday morning. 
                        There are over 700 in the UK alone. At Uni, my partner's flatmate had started taking part and running half marathons 
                        so I was intrigued to give it a go. I had heard of parkrun from my mathematics teacher at school and even signed up online.
                        Unfortunately, as a student I had always selected a lie in rather than the idea of running 5000 metres.  
                        I did not know what to expect but was amazed to find myself enjoying the experience and feeding off
                        everyone's energy. There was something about the friendliness and the together of running in unison with others
                        which made me want to come back. I would encourage others to give parkrun a go if they are able to.

                        After coming home from parkrun I switched the televsion on. I have always loved
                        playing and watching sport. From watching the olympics to playing 5 aside. Today Eliud 
                        Kipchoge broke the 2 hour marathon at the <a href="https://www.ineos159challenge.com">Ineos 1:59 Challenge.</a> </a>
                        I must admit, I did not realise the scale of how hard this was initially. I think this youtube
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A73HQwEct-o">video</a> describe the enormity of the situation.
                        After the parkrun in the morning and watching this, I thought this is a sport I can get into.

                        Over the past three years I have kept running and going to Parkrun. I have attended many different
                        (global pandemic cancelled many) parkruns and love the health/mental benefits that running 
                        gives me. I have improved massivley since the 12th October 19 but still have a lot more to 
                        improve upon and am by no means an expert. As I ran more, one of the questions I asked myself
                        was how I could measure progress? Being a data nerd I kept a spreadsheet of all runs
                        since my first parkrun. I wanted to create something automated where the only manual process
                        was to enter each run into my spreadsheet. Below enjoying some crisps.

                        So, a question someone might think is: Excel has built in graphs why don't you use them?
                        When analysing or producing data visualisation I think a key theme is automate your analysis 
                        as much as possible. This way, if you have carry out similair analysis in the future you don't have to 
                        re-invent the wheel and keeping having to edit a spreadsheet. Furthermore,the bigger your dataset the 
                        more appropriate it is to use tools like Python. My dataset in this case is very small (few hundred rows)
                        but if I was given a dataset with hundreds of thousands of rows with a large amount of runners, I would 
                        be able to use the tools & techniques with python/pandas to analyse this data. I am also able to version 
                        control my code and result using a tool like GIT. The full repository of the code can be found <a href="https://github.com/Antonio-John/running">here.</a>

                     A data pipeline can be thought off as a flow of data going through a pipe, having various tranformations along the way
                     and outputing some tables/charts which can be used to help analyse a problem. My running pipeline three stages can be found in the
                     readme.MD of the repository. Here is a diagram which descibes the process

                    After writing the code the only steps I am involved in is the manual input of data at the start and the analysing of charts
                    to see which areas I need to work on. The middle three scripts are all python scripts which takes the input data from the steps
                    before and outputs data for the next step. An example of one of the charts can be seen below.

                       This chart is a mock up of what running miles per month might look like. This is just one of the charts that are 
                       produced automatically which I can then analyse and look at. Matplotlib is used in this process and all functions are unitested. I think having this automated
                       process can save so much time. This is just a small pipeline intended for my own purpose but when thinking about how creating
                       pipelines like these can be applied to big business datasets the efficient & productivy savings can be enormous. The power python 
                       and automation has to reduce a messy unclean business dataset with thousands of row to something tangible and meaningful to analyse is amazing.

                       I would like to build a dashboard to create a more dynamic user interface. This would allow me to cut and slice the data in any way
                       I desired. Explore the posibility of writing the data in some sort of cloud SQL server like postgresql. Build templates of the raw data, so anyone
                       can run the pipeline for themselves with their own running data. Include more charts on a type of run basis e.g interval, long run, easy run etc..
