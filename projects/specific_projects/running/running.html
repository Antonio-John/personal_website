                        On the 12th October 2019 I decided to attend a <a href="https://www.parkrun.org.uk">parkrun</a>. If you aren't aware of these,
                        they are a free timed 5K event that happen in parks across the worlds every Saturday morning. 
                        There are over 700 in the UK alone. At Uni, my partner's flatmate had started taking part and running half marathons 
                        so I was intrigued to give it a go. I had heard of parkrun from my mathematics teacher at school and even signed up online.
                        Unfortunately, as a student I had always selected a lie in rather than the idea of running 5000 metres.  
                        I did not know what to expect but was amazed to find myself enjoying the experience and feeding off
                        everyone's energy. There was something about the friendliness and the together of running in unison with others
                        which made me want to come back.

                        After coming home from parkrun I switched the televsion on. I have always loved
                        playing and watching sport. From watching the olympics to playing 5 aside

                        One of my assesments was to decrypt random text using different ciphers. Python and coding in general is a 
                        very powerful tool as it allows us to compute and automate processes which can be very time consuming when done manually.
                        I wanted to create an automated process to do this, so started writing some code which allowed me decrypt/encrypt text. 
                        The four ciphers I focussed on were atbash, ceaser, playfair and vigenere. Not going to go too much into detail about 
                        the specific code but it is all publicaly available here on <a href="https://github.com/pyantonio-coder/crypto/tree/main">github</a>. 
                        It is split into seperate scripts as below:
                    </p>

                <div class = "info_cv">
                    <p class = "cv_paragraph">
                        Contained within the cryptology.py script are the eight main functions of the ciphers mentioned above (one for encryption and one for decryption). 
                        Full docs for these functions can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/pyantonio-coder/crypto/blob/main/README.md">Readme.MD</a> on the github page.
                        The tools.py script contain mini function which are used within the eight main functions. They break the main functions into smaller, easily 
                        managable chunks of code. This makes it easier to debug code as well as unittest code. Every function created within these two files are tested
                        within the tests folder. I used the unittest framework but other frameworks like Pytest are available.

                       The above code helped me answer my assesment questions but one of the great things about Python is the ability to share and distribute 
                       code to others. This was my first time attempting this, the guidance I used was a

                        the code to be distibuted but with a copyright notice.

                        Once everything was ready I could upload the package to Pypi. This is a library of over 330,000 python packages!
                        The process I used to do this was the following:

                        Sdist is short for Source Distribution. This commands took all the information from the setup.py files
                        and created the package information/files for me. With this command the package is stored locally, 
                        the last thing I needed to do was to upload the package to PyPi. There are several ways to do this
                        but the method I used was using an existing package called twine. With the following command this uploaded everything 
                        for me. I got onto the PyPi quick enough to see my package on the home page.

                       There are many other cryptological techniques that exist including Hill & Rotor ciphers. These will be created as issues
                       on the github page to be picked up by anyone. I'd also like to automate the testing potentially a tox file. This is an 
                       area I would like to know more on. This would allow the automation of checking that all unit tests are passing instead of manually having to run them.
                       I learnt a great deal whilst publishing the code and if you want to be able to distribute your code for anyone to used
                       this is a great learning opportunity.
