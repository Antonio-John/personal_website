                        One of my favourite films is the Imitation game featuring Benedict Cumberbatch and Keria Knightley. 
                        This film tells the story of a mathematician Alan Turing who tries to break the german Enigma Code.
                        The Enigma Code was a method of encrypting messages. This enabled the german army to send messages
                        to each other without fear of messages being intercepted and decoded. I really recommend watching
                        if you haven't had the pleasure.

                        This lead me to be more interested in the field of cryptology and the history surrounding it. 
                        In my Undergraduate degree I chose to study a module in cryptology. The module highlighted the 
                        history surrounding cryptology from ancient greece to the present day. There has always been the 
                        need for secrecy and I find it curious how these mathematically based ciphers were developed. Below
                        is an ancient technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scytale"> Scytale</a>. This focuses
                        on writing a message into a single strip of parchment. The two communicators would use a same size rod and 
                        decrypt the message by wrapping the parchment round their rods.

                        One of my assesments was to decrypt random text using different ciphers. Python and coding in general is a 
                        very powerful tool as it allows us to compute and automate processes which can be very time consuming when done manually.
                        I wanted to create an automated process to do this, so started writing some code which allowed me decrypt/encrypt text. 
                        The four ciphers I focussed on were atbash, ceaser, playfair and vigenere. The structure of the code can be found
                        on <a href="https://github.com/pyantonio-coder/crypto/tree/main">github</a>. It is split into seperate scripts
                        as below:

                <div class = "info_cv">
                    <p class = "cv_paragraph">
                        Contained within the cryptology.py script are the eight main functions of the ciphers mentioned above (one for encryption and one for decryption). 
                        Full docs for these functions can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/pyantonio-coder/crypto/blob/main/README.md">Readme.MD</a> on the github page.
                        The tools.py script contain mini function which are used within the eight main functions. They break the main functions into smaller, easily 
                        managable chunks of code. This makes it easier to debug code as well as unittest code. Every function created within these two files are tested
                        within the tests folder. I used the unittest framework but other frameworks like Pytest are available.

                       The above code helped me answer my assesment questions but one of the great things about Python is the ability to share and distribute 
                       code to others. This was my first time attempting this, the guidance I used was a 
                       <a href="https://python-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/shipping/packaging/">Hitchkiers Guide to packaging code</a> along with this helpful

                       call cryptology.
