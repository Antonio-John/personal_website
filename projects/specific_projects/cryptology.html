                        One of my favourite films is the Imitation game featuring Benedict Cumberbatch and Keria Knightley. 
                        This film tells the story of a mathematician Alan Turing who tries to break the german Enigma Code.
                        The Enigma Code was a method of encrypting messages. This enabled the german army to send messages
                        to each other without fear of messages being intercepted and decoded. I really recommend watching it
                        if you haven't had the pleasure.
